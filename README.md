# SoberUp

SoberUp is a Pebble smart watch app for counting standard drinks, estimating BAC, and learning about the effects of alcohol on the body.

SoberUp was made by Team AlumniLikeTurtles: [Kevin Conley](https://github.com/kevincon), [Evan Benshetler](https://github.com/ebensh), [Jeff Kiske](https://github.com/jkiske), and [Matt Hale](https://github.com/yoknapatawpha). It was (mostly) built in under 40 hours at the PennApps Spring 2014 hackathon at the University of Pennsylvania, where it was awarded "Best Pebble Hack" by the Pebble team.

## Building the project

With the [Pebble SDK installed](developer.getpebble.com), navigate to the root folder of the repository and run:

     pebble build

## Contributions

Although we don't plan on developing SoberUp further, we welcome contributions from the community. Here are some possible ideas:

* Refactor the DrinkingState-related structs and functions out of main.c and into a separate file, like state.c.
* Add a "reference sheet" for common types of drinks and how many standard drinks they represent, accessible by clicking the center Pebble button.
* Add different kinds of drink inputs, perhaps configurable from the javascript-based settings page.
* Animate the stopwatch icon while the countdown to 0 BAC is active.
* Animate the cycle of the alcohol effects.
